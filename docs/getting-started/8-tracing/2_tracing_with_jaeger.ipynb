    "# Tracing Guardrails with Jaeger\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo Guardrails supports the Open Telemetry ([OTEL](https://opentelemetry.io/)) standard, providing granular visibility into server-side latency. It automatically captures the latency of each LLM and API call, then exports this telemetry using OTEL. You can visualize this latency with any OTEL-compatible backend, including Grafana, Jaeger, Prometheus, SigNoz, New Relic, Datadog, and Honeycomb.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to use [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) to visualize NeMo Guardrails latency. Jaeger is a popular, open-source distributed tracing platform used to monitor production services. This notebook walks through the process in three stages:\n",

    "1.  Download and run Jaeger in standalone mode.\n",
    "2.  Configure NeMo Guardrails to emit metrics to Jaeger.\n",
    "3.  Run inferences and view the results in Jaeger.\n",

We believe that taking breaks and vacations is essential for our employees\\' well-being and productivity. \\n\\nAccording to our company handbook, full-time employees are eligible for 15 days of paid vacation per year, in addition to 10 paid holidays and 5 personal days. Part-time employees, on the other hand, accrue PTO at a rate of 1 hour for every 20 hours worked, up to a maximum of 40 hours per year.\\n\\nNow, here\\'s how it works: employees can start accruing PTO from their very first day of work, but they can\\'t take any time off until they\\'ve completed their 90-day probationary period. After that, they can start requesting time off, and we encourage them to give us as much notice as possible so we can make sure to cover their responsibilities while they\\'re away.\\n\\nWe also offer a flexible PTO policy, which allows employees to take time off in increments as small as a half-day. And, if an employee needs to take an extended leave of absence for a family or medical emergency, we have a separate policy in place to support them.\\n\\nOne thing to note is that PTO accrues throughout the year, but it doesn\\'t roll over to the next year if it\\'s not used. So, employees should make sure to use their PTO before the end of the year, or they\\'ll lose it. We do, however, offer a \"cash-out\" option for unused PTO at the end of the year, which can be a nice little bonus for employees who haven\\'t taken all their time off.\\n\\nI hope that helps clarify our company\\'s PTO policy! Do you have any specific questions or scenarios you\\'d like me to address?'}]\n"
